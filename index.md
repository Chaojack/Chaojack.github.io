## About me
I'm a master's student in the School of Information Management at Nanjing University. I had a great time doing research, and now I'm looking for some opportunities to study as a PhD student after graduating in 2023. I'm also a big boxing fan but a terrible boxer. I fought three bouts yet won only one of them. \
If you're interested, here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf).
