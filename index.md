### About me

I'm a master's student in the School of Information Management at Nanjing University. I had a great time with my research, and now I'm looking for some opportunities to study as a PhD student after graduting in 2023. I'm also a big boxing fan but a terrible boxer. I fought 3 bouts yet won only 1 of them.
